# Machine Learning Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of small, complete machine learning projects
designed to demonstrate understanding of core ML concepts, algorithms, and workflows.

Each project is intentionally scoped to focus on a specific idea, from foundational algorithms
implemented from scratch to applied models using real datasets.

## Purpose

This repository exists to:
- Reinforce machine learning fundamentals through implementation
- Demonstrate end-to-end ML workflows on small, focused problems
- Combine theory and practice through experimentation
- Build a strong foundation for larger ML and AI systems

## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- scikit-learn
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Notes

These projects are designed to be readable and educational, not optimized for production.
